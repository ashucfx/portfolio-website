        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="intro-lead">Founder-led Business Development professional dedicated to building scalable revenue, meaningful client relationships, and sustainable business growth through clarity, trust, and strategic execution.</p>

      <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>I'm Ashutosh Shukla, a founder-led Business Development professional based in Noida, India. I'm passionate about building scalable businesses and helping organizations grow through strategic sales, clear communication, and sustainable relationships. Over the past several years, I've independently closed 60+ paid client deals, managed $250K+ in cumulative project value, and built long-term relationships with 35+ international clients across the USA, UK, UAE, Singapore, Australia, Germany, and beyond.</p>
        <p>What drives me is the belief that growth isn't just about numbers—it's about building trust and delivering genuine value. I've worked directly with founders, business leaders, and decision-makers to understand their challenges, translate them into solutions, and execute with accountability. I don't just manage deals; I own them from discovery through delivery and beyond.</p>
        <p>Beyond sales, I own complete business strategy—from service architecture and pricing structures to process design and brand positioning. I founded Ripple Nexus to help businesses leverage technology and professional branding to scale revenue and strengthen their market presence. I think and act like a founder: balancing client value, operational capabilities, and long-term sustainability.</p>

        <h2>What Makes Me Different</h2>
        <div class="differences-grid">
          <div class="diff-item">
            <div class="diff-icon">🎯</div>
            <h3>Founder Mindset</h3>
            <p>I think beyond individual transactions. Every engagement is viewed through a founder's lens—sustainability, scalability, and long-term value creation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="diff-item">

            <h3>Ethical Selling</h3>
            <p>I won't push solutions that don't fit. If a prospect isn't the right fit, I'll say so. Trust compounds when clients know you're not selling blindly.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="diff-item">
            <div class="diff-icon">⚡</div>
            <h3>Calm Under Pressure</h3>
            <p>Sales cycles involve uncertainty, objections, and scope creep. I stay calm, listen actively, and focus on solutions rather than getting defensive.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="diff-item">
            <div class="diff-icon">🔄</div>
            <h3>End-to-End Ownership</h3>
            <p>From prospecting through delivery and beyond. I don't hand off after closure—I ensure every client succeeds and sees the value promised.</p>

          <div class="diff-item">
            <div class="diff-icon">📈</div>
            <h3>Strategic Growth Focus</h3>
